IMP administrator(s) can assign different permissions to User Groups. The user group permission can be assigned either at the Resource Group level or at the individual interface level.</p> <p>IMP administrator can assign role privilege on the Resource Group level, which all individual interfaces under the resource group will inherit the role privileges. The Resource Group Level permission provides granular access control for all resources in the same Resource Group. The Resource Group Level also enables newly provisioned interfaces to be accessible to the user groups with access to the Resource Group without updating the permission. Alternatively, the IMP administrator can assign role privilege on the individual resource level. Simply set the role to None on the resource group and expand the individual resources. Then set the role for individual resources.
